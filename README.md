Gradle plugin for JavaSchema2Pojo processor.


#### Reasoning

Plugin is an unofficial jsonschema2pojo gradle plugin, forked from the official one. Main package is renamed to state that this is not an official plugin.

Goals of a fork is simple:
* Publish to Gradle Plugin Repository
* Customise and extend configuration to make it more human-readable and human-writable than it is now
* Add custom options indirectly supported but missing in the official libary
* Add an ability to provide extensions for jsonschema2pojo library within Gradle build configuration
